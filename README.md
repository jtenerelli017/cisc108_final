# Notes
This is a college assignment I completed for the University of Delaware in Fall 2019. My personal code is based on a template provided by my professor to help get me and other students started. For example, `cisc108_game.py` was provided to me and remains unaltered. In simple terms, `project_starter.py` was provided to me with some code that defines what a "game" is, but the code for the game concept (a square that jumps) was implemented by me.

# Instructions
1. Ensure Python v3.7 or later is installed.
2. Open a command-line terminal and set your working directory as the root of this project.
3. Execute the following command: `pip install arcade`.
4. Execute the following command: `pip install cisc108`.
5. Run the program by executing `py project_starter.py` (or `[Python install path] project_starter.py` if your PATH is not set).
6. (Optional) Run the test program by executing `py project_starter_tests.py` (or `[Python install path] project_starter_tests.py` if your PATH is not set).
